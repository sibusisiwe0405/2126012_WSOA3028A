                    <em>W</em>hen I first heard of the term UX then heard its full meaning (User Experience) I was confused as to why they had chosen and X instead of the E. 
                    Looking at it now UX honestly sounds and looks cooler than UE and to be quite honest this is partly why UX and UI are my favourite part of interactivity. 
                    <p class="Dera">User experience </p>
                    <p>
                        Hassenzahl and Tractinsky mention that the term UX is associated with many meanings such traditional usability to beauty, hedonic, affective or experiential aspects of technology use (Tractinsky, 2011). To me UX is about usability and how a user(other party other than yourself) feels after using the product, and whether they were able to use the product from the first attempt with no explanation needed. When putting UX into consideration when designing a product, I like to think of the basic principles of design: Discoverability and feedback. 
                        When someone(user) is using your product they should be able to discover what operations they can do and these operations should reflect back with a signal of what is happening. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In this case I will be reflecting on UX and UI and I will be doing so by analysing my own website and how I have taken into consideration the factors and principles of the two terms.
                         The website is user-centred so it was built in hopes that it will be used by clients one day and therefore the decisions made when designing it had the future user in mind and how I want them to feel and experience the site. With this in mind my goal was to offer an engaging experience for the users with the work done by the company.  </p>

                            The navigation bar at the top is very simple, easy to use and each section has exactly what the menu displays. I made use of links to revert back to different pages such as my blog pages for example; for each blog I have a previous and next button which a user can use to go back to the previous blog or to the next one.
                             I believe that this is convenient because the users dont have to keep going to the initial blog page and selecting the next blog.
                             The buttons are at the top of the page because when I tried making them move up and down as you scroll they would move at a different pace making it look disorientated so I kept it safe by sticking them at the top. I made the buttons visible by making use of a dark warm colour and when the mouse hovers on the button it gives feedback to the user and turns a different colour when clicked on.  
                             <br>
                             In my About section where I explain what the business does I added a link to the portfolio page which displays pervious work done. I did this so that the client finds the portfolio easily just after reading about it they are able to visualize what I had spoken about since the websites focus is the portfolio after all. I wanted my site to be in sync and flow which is why I have the about page and the blogs next to each other because they both are mainly about the text.
                              The portfolio follows ending with the style guide which has the reflection and wireframes explaining the process of building the site.

                         <p class="Dera">User Interface</p>
                         <p>
                            Unlike UX which makes interfaces useful and helps users accomplish goals UI (user interface) is about visual and interaction design and makes interfaces beautiful and readable. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            I wanted my website to have a warm and bold interface and so I made use of warm dark colors such as red and brown. I felt that these colours accommodate all types of users as my target market is basically everyone, young or old. The look of the website is traditional and simple with nor much flashy graphics or animations. The blog page however has a uniquely styled blogs that the user can click on and the navigation has animation effects unlike the rest of the website. I did this due to the fact that there is a lot of reading that the user may have to do in these pages and I wanted to add something fun to divert from the frustration of reading. 
                            I have a bright abstract background, and this may make it hard to read text however I added backgrounds to them so that it is easy to read.

                         <p class="Dera">Conclusion</p>
                         <p>
                            As I continue to develop my website I want to work more on my UX and UI designs as there is a lot more I can do to improve on it and make it accessible to everyone. I want to add more UX such as things like influencing user behaviour with elements that subconsciously influence the user. I aim to make the main focus of my UX and UI design on creating outstanding quality experiences rather than preventing usability issues (Tractinsky, 2011).
