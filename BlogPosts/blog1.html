      <article><em>M</em>arshall McLuhan was a visionary, way ahead fo his time. He saw the future which we have come to witness, and we have become apart of theories that he had spoken about. 
        He predicted an interconnected and interactive world which is now our reality. 
        He speaks of the medium(media) in which the message is sent or received being of great importance rather than the message(information) itself.

<p> Mediums have changed human behaviour in various ways, they have the biggest influence on us, especially in the way which our brains function. Technological advancements and augumantations have weakened the human brain capacity and its become dependant on the internet, this is merely a result of the social and personal consequences of mediums (McLuhan, 1994). 
    The mediums have made us so lazy we text in short or better yet, use emojis to express emotions. Mass production is a thing of the past. We no longer really sit in front of television screens and watch the latest news, instead we log into twitter or facebook and are updated with the latest news and gossip. We live in a time where we are no longer just consumers of the media but are able to create our own information within the media.

    <p>McLuhan mentions how social and cultural understandings are impossible without the knowlegde of the media (McLuhan, 1964). It has become prominent and potentially as importatnt as natural resources. Mediums have overlapped content which they produce going against their conventions and is slowly becoming extentions of humanity. With automisation on the rise as people lose jobs, new skills are required for the new jobs that are appearing (McLuhan, 1994).   </p>

    <p>From a digital artist perspective and looking at this piece of writing which made predictions we currently are seeing, its hard not to be intrigued. You think about the future and predictions that are currently being made. The metaVerse for example is about to take the world by a huge surprise, with jobs being created within the virual reality spaces, privacy and anonimity becoming close to non-existent, we start to wonder if we can take these advancements as humanity. </p>
