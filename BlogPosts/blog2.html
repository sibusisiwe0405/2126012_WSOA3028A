                    <em>W</em>hat is a URL? A URL is a link used by the browsers to attain published resources on the web, so essentially it is an address used to locate resources on the web. 
                    Everything accessed through the Web has a URL and it is usually located at the top of the browser address bar. 
                    It is an abbreviation for Uniform Resource Locator and functions through the concept of hypertext a term coined by Theodor Holm.

                        URLs are key concepts of the web and they point to a unique resource (Mozilla, 1998), such as an image from the internet that can be linked to an HTML document or CSS stylesheet. These resources represented by the URL are handled by the Web server which can be removed and no longer exist on the web if removed (Mozilla, 1998). 
                    </p>

                        There are different components that make up a URL with some being mandatory and some not as important. The structure usually goes as follows: There is the Protocol or Scheme which is used to gain access to the internet (Scarpati, n.d.) . This is the first part of a URL which is mandatory to have, and they start with http, https. The second part that follows is the Domain name. The Domain is the identifier of a specific web page which would be the actual name of the website. This domain, also known as the authority is separated from the protocol with a character pattern like so :// , and end with .com, .org, .za etc (Mozilla, 1998). The last part of a URL is known as the Path. 
                        Each page on a website has its own path and this part takes you directly to the information and locates a file in the web server.

                        There are other parts that a URL consists of but the three listed above are the main and most important. Out of all the components a URL may have, the Domain is the key concept, as it creates an online footprint/presence.
