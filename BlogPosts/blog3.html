        <article> <em>I</em>n the creative/design field many things have to be considered in order to have a user-friendly product.
             Whenever creating these products or providing a service, it is a key factor to make sure it is accessible to everyone (target market) and so on, however what is accessibility and why is it important?
            <p>
                Accessibility is the ability to reach, use or enter something with ease. For example, using the statement above, an individual should be able to reach and use products and services swiftly, this accessibility has emphasis on the disabled. 
                They too should be able to use products and services with ease. This then means that in the design process the designers must consider visual, audio, physical, cognitive etc disabilities when putting into place the accessibility measures.

            <p>In the digital context that we are in we talk of web accessibility, which when well-designed delivers information efficiently and allows a wide range of individuals to access it. 
                Web accessibility is important for every user of the web regardless of disabilities, it is inclusive to all. An accessible web promotes usability, and this yields many results such as intuitive user experience and essentially is user-friendly (UNCG, 2019). </p>

                <p>I watched a video where Don Norman was talking about Norman doors (which are essentially bad doors) and referring to the principle of design. This topic on accessibility made me rethink the concept of a Norman door and understand the importance of accessibility.
                     The video talks about how bad doors are everywhere and once one starts paying attention to this they will notice. These bad doors cause frustration to people due to their inability to use them, not because of certain disadvantages but simply due to their design. The argument that Norman makes is that there wouldn’t be a need to put up signs showing how to use the door if it was designed right (Vox, 2016). People obviously get frustrated by bad doors and complain and the next step would be to fix the door or replace with a usable one which in turn costs more money. Just like web accessibility, if it is done right, it saves the developers unnecessary costs that would come with changing/fixing a website that isn’t accessible. </p>

                     <p>The design of the web pages should have obvious signs that make it usable and easy to engage with. It is therefore important to have accessibility in place so as to attract, engage and interest customers/clients that interact with the web page rather than have them frustrated and looking for another website. </p>
