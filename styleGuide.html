            During the course of this semester i have learnt quite a few fundumentals to building a website.
            It has been a wonderful experience developing this website though there have been many changes along the way.
            For starters my landing page and navigation has changed from what i had initially planned.
            This was due to seeing other websites and being inspired by them. I wanted something bold, that captures your attention and makes you want to keep browsing.
            <p> With my intention of wanting something that is bold and draws attention, i decided to go with an abstract background image with a bold red and subtle browns.
                I then included browns and nude solid colors to highlight text and some images. </p>
                <p>The color palette below shows the colors that I used for my website. With these colors i wanted to give a warm and bold feel and appearance to the site.
                    Usually the background color of websites is white or a solid color, I tried switching this up for mine and do something different and hoping it works.
                </p>
                <p>The font that i used for the blogs and the headings was Satisfy-Regular which i felt gave off a formal and traditional feel. The look of the business
                    is a timeless classic and unique modern feel and i wanted this to reflect through the chosen font, color palatte and structure.
